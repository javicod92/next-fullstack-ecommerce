# Next Fullstack e-commerce

This project is a complete e-commerce platform with a focus on efficient administration and user experience. It has two main sections:
- **Administrator panel (Backend)**: Exclusively for administrators, it allows only administrators to add, modify and delete products and categories on the site
- **User section (Frontend)**: Designed for users to browse and consume the products published in the store

## üõ†Ô∏è Common technologies used in Backend and Frontend:
- **Next.js 15**: React framework, for creating faster server-side web applications
- **React 19**: JavaScript library for creating dynamic and reusable user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: JavaScript superset for adding static typing and error prevention
- **Tailwindcss, css and css modules**: To provide the user with modern interfaces
- **MongoDb Atlas**: Database used for storing Users, Products and Product Categories
- **Cloudinary**: Used to store product images
- **Mongoose**: Used to manage the non-relational database MongoDb
- **Axios**: JavaScript library used to easily handle HTTP requests and responses

**Backend**
- **NextAuth.js v5**: Used to validate credentials and allow only administrator users to modify page content

**Frontend**
- **Stripe**: Used to accept online customer payments
- **React-toastify**: Used to display notifications to the user
- **Motion**: Used to add animations to react components

## üöÄ Main Functions
### Backend

**Credential creation and validation:**
- User registration and data validation via NextAuth V5, using Google as login provider
- Administrator user based on the NextAuth user role settings
- Creation of user and role schemas stored in mogoDB Atlas database
