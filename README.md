# Next Fullstack e-commerce

This project is a complete e-commerce platform with a focus on efficient administration and user experience. It has two main sections:
- **Administrator panel (Backend)**: Exclusively for administrators, it allows only administrators to add, modify and delete products and categories on the site
- **User section (Frontend)**: Designed for users to browse and consume the products published in the store

## üõ†Ô∏è Common technologies used in Backend and Frontend:
- **Next.js 15**: React framework, for creating faster server-side web applications
- **React 19**: JavaScript library for creating dynamic and reusable user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: JavaScript superset for adding static typing and error prevention
- **Tailwindcss, css and css modules**: To provide the user with modern interfaces
- **MongoDb Atlas**: Database used for storing Users, Products and Product Categories
- **Cloudinary**: Used to store product images
- **Mongoose**: Used to manage the non-relational database MongoDb
- **Axios**: JavaScript library used to easily handle HTTP requests and responses

**Backend**
- **NextAuth.js v5**: Used to validate credentials and allow only administrator users to modify page content

**Frontend**
- **Stripe**: Used to accept online customer payments
- **React-toastify**: Used to display notifications to the user
- **Motion**: Used to add animations to react components

## üöÄ Main Functions
### Backend

**Credential creation and validation:**
- User registration and data validation via NextAuth V5, using Google as login provider
- Administrator user based on the NextAuth user role settings
- Creation of user and role schemas stored in mogoDB Atlas database
- Only users with "Admin" role have access to the administration page

**Web application divided into simple pages or sections:** <br/>
*1) Dashboard Page:*
- Currently, the dashboard page displays the name and picture of the google account with which the user is logged in
- In the future, it is possible to add information about the trends of the most demanded products

*2) Products Page:*
- This page allows the user to create, edit and delete products stored in the database
- Each product added, has a title, description, price, category and images
- Product images can be reordered as required by the user

*3) Categories Page:*
- This page allow the user create, edit and delete product categories stored in the database
- Categories can have parent categories such as: Mobiles > iPhone
- Categories, they can also have properties such as color, storage and others

*4) Orders Page:*
- On this page, the orders realized by users are listed in a table
- The orders have a status that informs with YES or NO if the payment was successful
- Orders, have the shipping location, user name and products requested
- For payments, I used stripe webhook to listen for payment events

*5) Settings Page:*
- This page was created to add or remove administrator users in the future or to adjust aspects of the page

*6) Logout Function:*
- This function allows the user to exit the page when the user no longer needs to use it

In the example I have used the registration and login with Google, but you could also use credentials validation such as email and password or other providers such as GitHub or others
